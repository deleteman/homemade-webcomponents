# Homemade Web Components

_Just like grandma used to make them..._

Welcome to Homemade Web Components, this is just a silly collection of Web Components I use for examples when I write articles about the topic.

You can take this code and turn it into your own library, honestly, the whole code is written so that adding new components is easy and quick.

## Examples
Both HTMl files in the root of the folder contain examples of how to import the library and how to use the components.

## Testing the examples 
The easiest way to test this, is to run `npx http-server` from the root of the project, and then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
